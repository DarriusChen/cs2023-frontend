A: Long time no see.
B: It's been six months. Where did you go before?
A: I went to Europe first, then to the United States and Iceland, and finally back to Taiwan.
B: You've been to many places, even traveled around the world.
A: Yeah, I experienced many different cultures. How about you? Where did you go?
B: I went to Japan for a 5-month exchange program. I was in the southern part of Japan. When did you depart and return to Taiwan?
A: I departed on September 17th and returned on March 31st. How about you?
B: I departed on September 22nd and returned to Taiwan on February 26th. Who did you meet after coming back?
A: I met David. We met next to the subway station, then went to the night market and watched a movie together before going home to rest.
B: The food at Taiwanese night markets is really cheap! How much did you spend on meals in Germany?
A: A plate of spaghetti cost about 15 euros, very expensive! Are things expensive in Japan?
B: Yes, they are expensive, but not as expensive as in Germany. A meal costs about 200 Taiwanese dollars. Prices in Germany are really high! So, how's the weather in Germany?
A: It snows frequently in Germany, very cold. I felt like a snowman reporter. Since you went to the southern part of Japan, it probably didn't snow, right?
B: My home is in the mountains, so even though I was in the southern part of Japan, it was still cold. I really wanted to become Elsa and let it go~
B: By the way, of all the places you visited in the past six months, which one left the deepest impression?
A: Venice. Riding a gondola along the canals, the scenery was incredibly beautiful.
B: And if I want to see the Northern Lights, where should I go?
A: You can go to Iceland. Although the weather in Iceland is very cold, the Northern Lights are stunning. It's easier to see them if you go in the summer, and there are many beautiful places to visit.
A: How about you? Are there any places in Japan that left a deep impression on you?
B: Yes! Although it wasn't in Kyushu, I also went to Hokkaido. Niseko Ski Resort in Hokkaido was incredibly beautiful, and the snow was fluffy like shaved ice.
A: What did you do there?
B: I went skiing. Although the skiing equipment was heavy, I really enjoyed the process of skiing. I also went to Lake Toya and stepped on a volcano that had erupted just three days earlier. I even took in a bit of volcanic ash. It was fun and thrilling.
A: It sounds very interesting!
B: Yes! It was an unforgettable experience, a precious one.
A: After returning to Taiwan, what do you plan to do?
B: I will continue to stay in Taiwan. How about you?
A: Because of this experience of going abroad, I've decided to pursue further studies abroad. I've decided to go to the United States for a master's degree!
B: Wow, your life is always full of challenges!
A: Yeah, every day feels like being a snowman reporter, almost freezing to death.
B: Keep going!
